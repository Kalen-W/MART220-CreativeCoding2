Write a 1/2 to page summary on TinkerCad’s circuit and code blocks.

	I’m not really too certain what to summarize about TinkerCad’s circuits and code blocks. TinkerCad’s circuits is a simulation of various forms of circuitry, and TinkerCad’s code blocks is a method of creating simple 3D geometry and animation through blocks representing code. The circuits seem especially useful for someone who would wish to plan a circuit out before spending the time and money constructing it in real life, and also seems a rather useful tool for anyone wishing to learn circuitry, because, again, it circumvents the need to actually purchase wires, breadboards, etc. For the code blocks, I can’t honestly say I really see the purpose of it, unless I guess someone wanted to use it to start learning about making 3D models from scratch using nothing but code. This wouldn’t really have any practical use-case as far as I know, but having knowledge of how 3D environments function on more of a base level probably has its benefits. And as far as the animation portion of it goes, I’m not personally aware of any present day form of 3D animation that uses such a programming approach, as general key-frames are simply used. Code blocks may have some more practical use that I’m simply not aware of however.
