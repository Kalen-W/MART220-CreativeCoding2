This is what I produced following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/5nSFArCgCXA

I wish to build upon this to make a game, though I'm unsure as to what type just yet. A FPS would be cool, but I kind of doubt I would be capable of making the necessary A.I., given I barely even understand what a state machine is. Perhaps I'll try doing something like an old school dungeon crawler.
