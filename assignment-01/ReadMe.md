I'm not sure what I want to do for a project because I have no idea what the project details or requirements are. On neither Moodle nor the external website could I find any description for the project. The only info the external website game me is that it's a "video wall project", and I'm not sure what that really means.

So, for now, that best answer I can give is simply a project I've been interested in tackling for a while now, and that's making a 2.5D raycasting engine in JavaScript. I'll obviously need to watch tutorials to complete this, but my hope is to then build off the tutorials to make a simple game.

Also, I wasn't sure if we were meant to submit something made with P5.js shapes, so, just in case, I tried creating a representation of a spinning 3D cube. It's somewhat in theme with wanting to make a raycasting engine I suppose, but the code is a terrible mess.
